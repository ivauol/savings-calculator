# savings-calculator

A basic savings calculator, which takes in values for a user's amount of cash they wish to put into savings, the number of years they wish to do so, and the expected yearly interest and inflation rates.

A graph is then generated using [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) to show fluctuations in cash value over this set period of time.
